<p>Hello World, I'm Krystal. My friends and family describe me as a person of few words. 
  I recently bought my forever home in South Boston, Virginia. 
  I was born in New Jersey and grew up in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. 
  I moved to Virginia almost seven years ago because I was extremely done with shoveling snow and I love the mostly beautiful weather here in Virginia. </p>

  <article><h2 class="text-centered">About Me</h2><p>I started my journey in web development around twenty years ago. 
    I attended classes to learn all about computers. 
     Computer Specialist classes included Microsoft Office, hardware repair, networking, and web design.
     I became painfully aware that I wasn't ready to sit at a desk. 
     I have worked in manufacturing for those 20+ years and I'm ready now! 
     I've been a part of some great teams and I have worked on different tasks alone. 
     I have done well in either situation.</p></article></main>
